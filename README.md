Student Segmentation and Subscription Tier Prediction :- Engineered feature dataset using layered CTEs and correlated subqueries of MySQL to aggregate course engagement metrics prior to segmentation modeling. Performed Unequal Variance t-test to assess whether 'Points Earned' metric significantly differs or not, across the users of different course ratings. Built a Predictive Machine Learning Model using Radial Kernel K-Means, SMOTE and XGBoost. This led to Student Segmentation and Subscription Tier Prediction based on course engagement metrics.
