Student Segmentation and Subscription Tier Prediction :- Built aggregated course-engagement features using MySQL CTEs and subqueries. Performed Unequal Variance t-test to assess whether 'Points Earned' metric significantly differs or not, across the users of different course ratings. Applied Radial Kernel K-Means for student segmentation and used XGBoost and a Neural Network for subscription tier prediction, with Logistic Regression as a stacking model to generate final predictions.
